# OpenNI Devices:

### Our lab has disposed the usage of OpenNI cameras, so we have moved to RealSense Cameras. All of the code I used to test are available here in this folder. But I was only used them for testing wireless communication purpose. I did not continue using them in the application stage.

> I made two subfolder to archive the code I used to test the wireless communication.

Please check each folder. ROS and Python.
